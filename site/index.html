It consists of 50 states, a federal district, five major unincorporated territories, nine minor outlying islands,[i] and 326 Indian reservations with limited sovereignty. It is the third-largest country by both land and total area.[c] The United States shares land borders with Canada to the north and with Mexico to the south as well as maritime borders with the Bahamas, Cuba, and Russia, among others.[j] With more than 331 million people,[d] it is the third most populous country in the world. The national capital is Washington, D.C., and the most populous city and financial center is New York City. The United States is known for its highly diverse climate and geography, encompassing landscapes that range from polar to tropical, arid to humid, and is officially recognized as one of the 17 megadiverse countries.

Paleo-aboriginals migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago, and advanced cultures began to appear later on. The various mound building cultures of the Eastern Woodlands culminated in the Mississippian culture that existed during the Medieval Warm Period, while the cliff-dwelling Pueblo culture existed in the American Southwest simultaneously. These advanced cultures had almost completely declined by the time European colonists showed up in the 16th century. The United States emerged from the Thirteen British Colonies established along the East Coast, when disputes with their colonial overlords over taxation and political representation led to the American Revolution (1765–1784), which established the nation's independence. In the late 18th century, the U.S. began expanding across North America, gradually obtaining new territories, sometimes through war, frequently displacing Native Americans, and admitting new states. This was strongly related to belief in manifest destiny, and by 1848, the United States spanned the continent from east to west.</p>
